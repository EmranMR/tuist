## Why would I use Tuist? {#why-would-i-use-tuist}

Why choose Tuist? Here are compelling reasons:

- **Simplify modularization:** As projects grow and span multiple platforms, modularization becomes crucial. Tuist streamlines this complexity, offering tools to optimize and better understand your project's structure.
- **Optimize workflows:** Leveraging project information, Tuist enhances efficiency through selective test execution and deterministic binary reuse across builds.
- **Foster healthy project evolution:** We provide insights into your project's dynamics and expert guidance for informed decision-making. This approach prevents the frustration and productivity loss associated with unhealthy projects, which can lead to developer attrition and missed business goals.
- **Replace costly platform teams:** Instead of investing in expensive, potentially risky in-house platform teams, let Tuist be your virtual expert. We offer consistent support without the vulnerabilities of relying on key individuals.
- **Break down silos:** Unlike platform-specific ecosystems (e.g., Xcode's contained environment), Tuist offers web-centric experiences and integrates seamlessly with popular tools like Slack, Prometheus, and GitHub, enhancing cross-tool collaboration.
